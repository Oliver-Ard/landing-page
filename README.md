# Landing Page

For this project, I created a landing page where I practiced basic CSS properties, like:

- CSS selectors
- the box model
- color & text styling
- Flexbox
- understanding of the cascade and the specificity

The main focus was on how to use the proper `Flexbox` properties to layout a page.
